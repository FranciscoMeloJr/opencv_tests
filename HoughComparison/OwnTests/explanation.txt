The Hough transform is a popular method for detecting straight lines (or potentially circles) in a noisy image. First the image must be converted to a binary image (black and white image, not grayscale), which is often performed using the Canny edge detector due to it's reliability and speed. The traditional Hough line detector in OpenCV provides the orientation of detected lines but not their start and end points, whereas the Probabilistic HoughLines detector gives start and end points of detected lines, therefore is useful for more applications.
